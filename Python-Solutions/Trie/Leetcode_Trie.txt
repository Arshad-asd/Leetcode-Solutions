208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)


```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.endOfword = False
```

- The `TrieNode` class represents a node in the Trie. Each node has a dictionary called `children`, where keys are characters and values are references to the child nodes. The `endOfword` attribute is a boolean that indicates whether a word ends at this node.

```python
class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
```

- The `Trie` class represents the Trie data structure. It has a constructor `__init__` that initializes the root node of the Trie.

```python
    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        cur = self.root

        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                cur.children[c] = TrieNode()
            cur = cur.children[c]
        cur.endOfword = True
```

- The `insert` method is used to insert a word into the Trie.
- Starting from the root node, for each character `c` in the word, it checks if `c` is already a child of the current node `cur`. If not, a new node is created and added as a child of `cur`.
- The traversal continues down the Trie for each character in the word, ensuring that the Trie structure represents the inserted word.
- After inserting all characters, the `endOfword` attribute of the last node is set to `True` to mark the end of the inserted word.

```python
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        cur = self.root

        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return cur.endOfword
```

- The `search` method is used to check if a word exists in the Trie.
- Starting from the root node, for each character `c` in the word, it checks if `c` is a child of the current node `cur`. If not, the word is not in the Trie, and the method returns `False`.
- If the traversal reaches the last character of the word, it checks if the `endOfword` attribute of the last node is `True`, indicating that the word exists in the Trie.

```python
    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        cur = self.root

        for c in prefix:
            if c not in cur.children:
                return False
            cur = cur.children[c]
        return True
```

- The `startsWith` method checks if any word in the Trie starts with a given prefix.
- Similar to the `search` method, it traverses down the Trie for each character in the prefix.
- If the traversal completes, it means the Trie contains words that start with the given prefix, so the method returns `True`.

# QUESTION NO: 211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure


```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.word = False
```

- The `TrieNode` class is similar to the previous explanation. Each node has a dictionary called `children` that maps characters to child nodes. Additionally, there's a `word` attribute that indicates whether a complete word ends at this node.

```python
class WordDictionary:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
```

- The `WordDictionary` class represents the dictionary structure that uses the Trie for efficient word storage.
- It has a constructor `__init__` that initializes the root node of the Trie.

```python
    def addWord(self, word: str) -> None:
        cur = self.root

        for c in word:
            if c not in cur.children:
                cur.children[c] = TrieNode()
            cur = cur.children[c]
        cur.word = True
```

- The `addWord` method is used to insert a word into the dictionary.
- It follows the same Trie insertion logic as before. For each character in the word, it traverses down the Trie, creating new nodes if necessary.
- After inserting all characters, the `word` attribute of the last node is set to `True`, marking the end of the inserted word.

```python
    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        def dfs(j, root):
            cur = root

            for i in range(j, len(word)):
                c = word[i]
                if c == ".":
                    for child in cur.children.values():
                        if dfs(i + 1, child):
                            return True
                    return False
                else:
                    if c not in cur.children:
                        return False
                    cur = cur.children[c]
            return cur.word
        
        return dfs(0, self.root)
```

- The `search` method is used to search for words in the dictionary, including wildcard searches where `'.'` can represent any character.
- It uses a depth-first search (`dfs`) approach to traverse the Trie and perform searches.
- The `dfs` function is defined within the `search` method. It takes two parameters: `j`, which represents the current index of the word being searched, and `root`, which is the current node in the Trie.
- The loop iterates through the characters starting from index `j`. If the character is `'.'`, it recursively explores all child nodes using a loop, effectively covering all possible characters.
- If the character is not `'.'`, it checks if the character is in the current node's children. If not, the search fails. Otherwise, it continues traversing the Trie.
- The search is successful if the traversal reaches the end of the word (reaches the last character) and the `word` attribute of the last node is `True`.
